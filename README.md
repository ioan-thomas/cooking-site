# The project 

This project was one which I did when completing a React & Firebase walkthrough. The main concepts of the webpage were done following along, however, during the walkthrough, I was given the opportunity to put what I learned from previous lessons, into practise. While there were many parts of the website that I completed without guidance an example of one wold be where I implemented fetching a recipe from a REST api, that supplies info based on the route parameter. Another example would be redirecting the user to and from different pages based on parameters, e.g. after completing a form, the user is returned to the homepage.
